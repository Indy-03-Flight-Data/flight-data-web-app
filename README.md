Local Testing Workflow:

    Frontend (React):
        When you run "npm start" in terminal in your React app (located in the client/ folder), the app will run on http://localhost:3000
    Backend (Node.js/Express):
        When you start your Node.js server by running "node server.js" in terminal, the backend will run on http://localhost:5000

Common terminal git commands:

    git pull origin master
    git add .
    git commit -m "Descriptive message about your changes"
    git push origin master
